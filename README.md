# TTNN 
## Algorithm for the low-rank approximation of a tensor in the Tree Tensor Network format

Package with the codes used for the experiment of the paper:

Randomized algorithms for streaming low-rank approximation in tree tensor network format (https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06111)

To use the package, a version of Matlab supporting tensorprod is required, for instance Matlab2023b.
To replicate the experiment first run the setup.m to include all the files in the directory and then run 

toy_example_hilbert_experiment.m   or   toy_example_khatri_rao_experiment.m
