This folder contains functions for rounding a 6-dimensional dense tensor already in TTN format with the toy example index tree.
In particular, there are the TTN-SVD, TTN-HMT and TTNN algorithms.
There are also the functions used to generate the sketchings, which are Khatri-Rao products of Gaussian DRMs.
